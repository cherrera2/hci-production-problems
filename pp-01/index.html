          <h2>PT Serif</h2>
          <p>
            The PT Serif font has an interesting history as it pays homage to
            type faces invented by Peter the Great nearly 3 centuries ago.

          <h2>Volkhov</h2>
          <p>
            The Volkhov font does not share the same rich history as PT
            Serif, but it does come from similar lineage being related to the
            serif typeface.

          <h2>Why both are amazing together</h2>
          <p>
            Similar to the pairings of Univers and Glypha, both PT Serif and
            Volkhov share a serif design. Not only that, but they have design
            elements that are not as common in other serifs. Particularly, the
            shape of the lowercase b does not have a stem that reaches the
            bottom. There are some slight differences in them though that make
            them disticnt from one another. For example, in Volkhov the middle
            line of the e slightly curves up while it stays straight in PT
            Serif. Additionally, for the "k" in PT Serif, the middle connects
            with a line while the two sections stay separate in Volkhov. BTW
            if you haven't noticed already, all of the headings for this
            webpage have been in Volkhov while the paragraphs have been in
            PT Serif (except for the examples).
