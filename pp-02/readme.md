## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=10e0u0kl7Rp9MYlg4V2pJMKv1Ge
Your Rationale: As a lot of videogames are suppose to be energetic and sometimes gets your blood pumping
                light red color pallet would fit well as it would bring the intensity
                a gamer would want, but not too intense that it would be overpowering.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=52d0u0keVLQ4zYZa1TujbCkn2uG
Your Rationale: With a garden, the color green is absolutely necessary. The yellow
                accents help as well as it can represent the sun that the plants
                use to grow. Additionally, the lighter saturation can make the
                website more calming which would be beneficial as many can see
                a garden as a place to relax and meditate.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=31z0u0kjq+C6c+SdH+JoH+2ujXs
Your Rationale: For a kids app, brighter colors are absolutely necessary as it
                keeps their attention, but it's important to not make it too bright
                and loud as it may become obnoxious and hard to look at. The colors
                also help as well as yellow can be associated with happiness, blue
                associated with energy, and purple associated with creativity.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=a3J3l0kpJQpeBVIk-SYviN7ID-D
Your Rationale: The color blue is a staple of cybersecurity which makes sense as blue
                can be a symbol of strength. The teal color can also represent
                strength as it is a combination of both blue and green. The subtle
                green inside of the teal can also add more energy to the website with
                the hint of money that the cybersecurity field is known for.
