## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results).

From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your
teams’s interface from Project Two**.

Finally, I highly encourage you to work on this Production Problem with your team for Project
Two/Three to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist, and smooth the way forward
for your first (and second) round of usability testing.

* Your team’s condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. Users usually expect that your site’s main logo will link to your homepage, so make sure you’ve done this.
2. Do you have “white space?” in your webpage? By placing too many elements close together, you may overwhelm users. Make some efforts and create a convenient and enjoyable layout.
3. Have you arranged information properly? Make it easy for users to find what they’re looking for by grouping related information together.
4. When a user makes a mistake or misses a question, warn him, so that he could write it properly.
5. Make sure the language in all texts is simple enough for all users to understand.
